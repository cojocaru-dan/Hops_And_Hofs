# hops-and-hofs

### In this project we display 20 types of beer on our webpage and we have the possibility to choose to see the best ale beer , to see all beers sorted ascending or descending, to see all beers filtered by some criteria or we can reset them to initial order.

### We use HTML, Javascript, DOM manipulation and algorithms.
